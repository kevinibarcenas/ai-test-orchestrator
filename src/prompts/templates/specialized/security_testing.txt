## Security Testing Focus Areas:

When generating test cases with security considerations:

### Authentication Testing:
- Valid/invalid token scenarios
- Token expiration handling
- Missing authentication headers
- Malformed authorization data

### Authorization Testing:
- Role-based access control
- Permission boundary testing
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Cross-user data access prevention

### Input Security:
- SQL injection attempts
- XSS payload testing
- Command injection scenarios
- Path traversal attempts

### Data Protection:
- Sensitive data masking
- HTTPS enforcement
- Data encryption validation
- PII handling compliance

Include security test cases when testing endpoints that:
- Handle user authentication
- Process sensitive data
- Perform administrative functions
- Accept user input for database operations
